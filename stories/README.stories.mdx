# Hi ðŸ‘‹

This Storybook documents the local patterns and practices used to build UIs with reactstrap.

Note that local documentation is provided first. And the [official Reactstrap Storybook](http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/reactstrap_home-installation--page) is included â€”Â below â€”Â for library reference.

When all else fails, [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/) is the true base-style resource.
